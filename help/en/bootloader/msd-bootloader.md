# Lufa Mass Storage Device Bootloader

It is based on lufa msd bottloader. 

Note: The USB disk drive mode here refers to the keyboard itself becoming a disk drive, not means that you need an additional USB disk to reflash the keyboard's firmware.

Many keyboards supported by ydkb.io use this method. The advantage of this method is that firmware refresh and reading can be completed without additional software.

> [!yddh] HINT:
> - There are two files, "keyboard_name.BIN" and "EEPROM.BIN", in the disk drive of flash mode. They are "virtual" files that are mapped to the contents of the FLASH and EEPROM of the keyboard controller.
> - Each time when re-entering the flash mode, their date is the same. Do not use the file date to determine whether the reflash is successful.


## Handling of reflash errors

Put this one first. 

If you reflash the wrong firmware or did not reflash successfully, you can no longer enter the flash mode, especially the wireless keyboard with battery. You need to turn off the keyboard's power switch, and re-enter the flash mode, reflash the correct firmware.


## Reflash firmware in Windows

The methods for different keyboards are basically the same. Generally, three step:

  1. press and hold the top left key or some other designated key (see the guide and info displayed on the corresponding keyboard of ydkb.io for details). Insert the USB cable to enter the flash mode.When the OS shows the drive disk, you can release the key. 
  2. Drag the firmware bin file(not case sensitive and the name need to be the same) to the disk drive to overwrite the original file.
  3. Eject the disk from OS or press ESC key to exit flash mode.(Some keyboards will automatically exit flash mode.)


## Reflash firmware in Mac

For macOS, please follow the steps below to flash the firmware using the command line.

For example, the downloaded file is HHKB_BLE.BIN, which is placed in the Downloads directory.

After connecting to the display flash disk, first execute the following command in the terminal, where HHKB_BLE is the name of the flash disk. Some disk names may have spaces after them. After entering the name, you can try pressing Tab to autocomplete to get the complete name.

```macOS
diskutil umount /Volumes/HHKB_BLE
```

The result obtained after execution is <code>Volume HHKB_BLE on <span style='color:red'><b>disk2</b></span> unmounted</code>, remember the `disk2` and it could be other `diskX` in your OS. Then execute the following command, note that the disk2 in this article corresponds to the result obtained by the previous command.
```macOS
sudo dd if=./HHKB_BLE.BIN of=/dev/disk2 seek=4
```

> [!ydda] ATTENTION
> - Don't change `seek=4`.

The `./HHKB_BLE.BIN` above is the relative path used because I run the command in the Download directory. You can also use the absolute path as follows, instead of typing it manually, after the command reaches `if=`, directly drag the BIN file to the terminal command window, and it will automatically obtain the absolute path of the BIN file.

```macOS
sudo dd if=/Users/yang/Downloads/HHKB_BLE.BIN of=/dev/disk2 seek=4
```

After waiting for the command to complete, the reflash is successful. The newer Bootloader will automatically exit the flashing mode, and some need to exit manually. The whole operation process is shown in the figure below.

## Reflash firmware in Linux

> [!yddh] HINT:
> - The following aspects are provided by netizen tb600211 686294 and I've tested it under Ubuntu 20.04.
> - Not guaranteed to be available on all Linux distributions. If not, when you need to flash the firmware, use windows to flash it.

1. The keyboard enters the flash mode, and the firmware is downloaded.
2. Use the following command to write the firmware, pay attention to the of=/dev/sdb, your system may be different, in my example it is the second disk of my computer, so it is sdb. `./HHKB_BLE.BIN` is a relative path, you can also use the absolute path of the BIN file.<br>
```linux
sudo dd if=./HHKB_BLE.BIN of=/dev/sdb seek=4
```
3. One more command is to be added.
```linux
sync
````


The content displayed during execution is as shown in the figure below.

The `/dev/sdb` above can be viewed with the `lsblk` command.

## If the keyboard repeatedly enters the flash mode

If this problem occurs, it is probably because the downloaded bin file is incorrect. You can open a bin file with a txt file editor and see if the content is empty. Or use a hexadecimal viewer to see if the front of the file is all FFFF.

The solution is to refresh the page (use Shift+F5) several times and re-download the firmware. And then reflash with the new correct firmware file.


## If the bin file cannot be overwritten

For windows, if you directly overwrite the bin and it says there is not enough space, open the explorer to display hidden files to see if this USB disk contains other files besides keyboard_name.bin and eeprom.bin. If the computer itself has virus and write some files to the disk, it will takes up space and make it impossible to write the new bin file.
