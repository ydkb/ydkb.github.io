# Linux pairing

The Bluetooth part of the BLE series keyboard itself uses the Bluetooth standard HID Over GATT service, because as long as the system hardware and software support BLE HID, there is no problem with pairing.

There are too many Linux distributions to illustrate one by one. Most of the user tests are normal, some self-compiled or very old, although the hardware supports BLE, but the driver has problems, which may cause unusable.

If you really want to use it on a special version, and the driver is unsure, you can also try to use [[ble-series:niz-dongle-paring|Niz Bluetooth 4.0 keyboard receiver]], this only needs the computer to support a USB keyboard can use.

When using Ubuntu, the interface after pairing is as follows.
