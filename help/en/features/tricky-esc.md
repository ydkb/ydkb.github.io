# Esc and \`\~

This is usefull for small size keyboard (65% and below).

## Common usage

In **LEDs and Functions**, you can see the buttons in the picture below, and you can set them directly.

<div style="width: 180px">

![](/assets/tricky-esc-v1.jpg?180)
</div>

Its main effect is:

<table_w30x70>

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| <key>~ Esc</key> | The trigger is the <key>Esc</key> key |
| <key>Shift+~ Esc</key> | It will output symbol <key>~</key> |
| <key>Ctrl+Shift+~ Esc</key>| The trigger is <key>Ctrl+Shift+esc</key> (shortcut key of Windows Task Manager), instead of becoming <key>Ctrl+\`~</key> |

</table_w30x70>

When a symbol <key>\`</key> is needed, generally set the Esc position of another layer (such as layer 1) to <key>\`\~</key>, then use L1+Esc The key can also be used to type <key>\`</key>.


## Advanced usage

The problem that may be encountered with the above use is that the set of shortcut keys <key>Shift+Esc</key> cannot be used anymore. This is the shortcut key to open the Chrome Task Manager.

So I have prepared some new things. This should be updated in the keyboard firmware after October 2020, and some will start to be added.

In **LEDs and Functions**, you can see the following three choices about Esc and \`\~.

<div style="width: 180px">

</div>
Two of them include L or R, that is, they are only valid for <key>LShift+~ Esc</key> or <key>RShift+~ Esc</key> to output <key>~</key>, the other <key>Shift+Esc</key> still maintains the original function.

At the same time, there is an easter egg. If you press and hold <key>LAlt</key> when you click this <key>~ Esc</key> to set, then the actually set button will add an extra function, which is a function prompt as follows.

<key>Alt+esc</key> is rarely used under win. Its function is to switch between the foreground windows, and most people use <key>Alt+Tab</key> to switch windows.

Therefore, for keyboards below 65% without the F4 key on layer 0, you can consider this setting and use <key>Alt+esc</key> to trigger the function of <key>Alt+F4</key>. The position of the two keys is also very easy to press with one hand.
